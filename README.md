# Archived

As I completly switched to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so this project is no longer actively maintained by me.

I archived this repo and set it to read-only, the source code however is still available here.

But I can't recommend using it without manual updates. Due to time constraints I cannot offer support for this.
